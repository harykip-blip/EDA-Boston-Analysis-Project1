# Boston Housing Price Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Boston Housing Dataset** to identify key factors influencing housing prices in Boston.  
It includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.

## Objectives
- Explore and visualize the dataset.
- Identify relationships between socio-economic and environmental factors.
- Derive insights about housing value determinants.

## Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis  
3. Visualization using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly  
4. SQL integration for data querying  
5. Documentation and GitHub publishing

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.1
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- SQL (MySQL or SQLite)
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## Data Source
Boston Housing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository / Scikit-learn built-in dataset)

**insights**

- The Boston Housing market is significantly influenced by socio-economic factors (LSTAT, PTRATIO) and physical housing characteristics (RM).

- The model suggests that wealthier, well-educated, and spacious neighborhoods tend to have higher home values.

- Environmental and accessibility factors also play a secondary role — proximity to the river increases value, while excessive urbanization may lower it.

- The dataset exhibits linear relationships, making it well-suited for regression modeling (especially Multiple Linear Regression).

**Recommendations**

- Urban planners and policymakers can use this insight to balance development and accessibility while improving education and living standards to uplift home values.

- For predictive modeling:

- Feature engineering on LSTAT, RM, and PTRATIO is highly recommended.

- Consider checking multicollinearity before regression modeling.

- Use transformations (like log or Box–Cox) for skewed variables
